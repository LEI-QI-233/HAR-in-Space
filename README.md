# HAR-in-Space
Human Action Recognition in Zero Gravity

## [Dataset](dataset): MicroG-4M :a new dataset for HAR, VQA, and Captioning under microgravity
This dataset is an open-source dataset specifically designed for Human Action Recognition in zero-gravity environments, aiming to support research and applications in this emerging field.

With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology, humans are expected to carry out increasing activities in space stations and space environments. Current human action recognition technologies are mainly developed for terrestrial environments and cannot effectively transfer to the zero-gravity conditions of space. Furthermore, existing datasets are insufficient for research related to space scenarios.

This dataset consists of publicly available video materials, including:

- Real space station videos provided by NASA
- Clips from space-themed movies

The dataset contains various human actions and object interaction behaviors typical of zero-gravity environments, suitable for training and validating related algorithms.

## Dataset Features

- The first dataset specifically for human action recognition in zero-gravity environments
- Includes real and simulated space scenario videos
- Covers diverse actions and interaction types, ideal for training and evaluating deep learning models

## Applications

- Astronaut training assistance
- Safety monitoring within spacecraft
- Human-computer interaction in zero-gravity environments
- Assisting space exploration missions
